*Note: Many years ago (around 2012) I became involved with the early 3D printing community and, as a result, created a number of 3D models.
I used to share highlights from those projects on my legacy blog, but I’ve decided to migrate some of that content here to help reconcile and preserve it.*

From time to time, I share my 3D models on [Thingiverse][Thingiverse], and this is one of those pieces.

This particular model was created by combining several existing [Thingiverse][Thingiverse] models by [Erik][erik], [Cerberus333][Cerberus333], [Prattotyper][Prattotyper], and 
[Friends][Friends] into a new merman design. 

The project was primarily an exercise in learning Blender (specifically how to edit, merge, and create models) and 
it serves as a complementary piece to my earlier [mermaid model][mermaid].
