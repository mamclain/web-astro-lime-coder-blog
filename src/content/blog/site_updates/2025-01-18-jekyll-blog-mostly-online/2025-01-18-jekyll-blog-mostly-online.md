So after spending a few hours, I have a mostly working static Jekyll blog that leverages a custom lime theme I created.

While I dabbled with [Jekyll][Jekyll] a year or so ago
(**as I was looking at making a dedicated [midjourney][midjourney] blog at the time**),
I never really got around to making a full-fledged blog with it. 

Static blogs were quite popular back in the day (**circa 2008**) and filled a niche for those of us who were tired of
dealing with PHP systems like [e107][e107] and the inevitable exploits that arose.

While there were a number of static blog systems that were available back then.

I wrote my own engine in Python that integrated into [Scrivener][Scrivener]
and used it for a few years on my [other developer blog][mamclain] before getting tired of
maintaining it.


Lately I have been feeling nostalgia for the days of having a static blog, 
and based off my prior experience with [Jekyll][Jekyll], I decided it would be a good foundation to build 
a new static blog on.

Currently, I have most of the core blog theme foundation in place;
However, I still need to add some `search` functionality and a few other features before I can consider it complete.

**I have some older code that I wrote while playing around with the midjourney blog that I can likely reuse for this endeavor**

Also, I was experimenting with [Elevenlabs][elevenlabs] Audio Native Tool
and applying my own custom voice for reading these blog posts.

Overall, there is a bit of a learning curve to get everything working and sounding ok,
But I am optimistic and I think it will be a nice feature to have on the blog.
